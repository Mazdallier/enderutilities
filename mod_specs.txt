* Ender Utilities 'Have too many of those bloody enderballs? Well this mod adds some uses for them!'
  - Ender Activator: Has an inventory for items, will use them when right clicking
    ~ Active slot selectable with sneak + scroll? When empty, uses the next one (with wrap).
    ~ What about items that would require sneak + right click? How do we access the activator's inventory?

  - Ender Armor: Teleports anyone who does melee damage, to 5 * number of armor pieces blocks away randomly;
    randomly redirects projectiles; uses enderpearls or eyes of ender as power/energy source, one pearl per enemy teleport

    "Use the mystical powers of the void to transfer all the knowledge and experiences of several years of life
    in a blink of an eye. Beware though, this might be too much for the subject to handle, and he has a 40% chance
